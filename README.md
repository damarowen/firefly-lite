## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application uses a simple but effective architecture to protect your API keys:

1.  The **Frontend** (built with React/Next.js) captures the URL you want to crawl.
2.  It sends a `POST` request to a **Next.js API Route** (`/api/crawl`) within this project.
3.  The API route, running securely on the **Server**, receives the request and calls the official Firecrawl API, attaching your secret `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.
4.  The response from Firecrawl is passed back to the frontend and displayed to you.

This ensures your secret API key is never exposed in the browser.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 18 or higher)
* `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
* A **Firecrawl API Key**. You can get one for free from the [Firecrawl website](https://www.firecrawl.dev/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/firefly-lite.git](https://github.com/your-username/firefly-lite.git)
    cd firefly-lite
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Firecrawl API key:
    ```
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result!
